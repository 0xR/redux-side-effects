> What if your reducers were generators? You could yield side effects and return application state.

Believe it or not, but side effects are still tied with your application's domain. Ideally, you would be able to keep them in reducers. But wait! Everybody is saying that reducers must be pure! So yeah, just keep the reducer pure and reduce side effects as well.
